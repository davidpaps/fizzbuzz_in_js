# Fizzbuzz in JavaScript

Today was my first day learning JavaScript! And what better thing to do with a new language, than to Test Drive good old FizzBuzz! 

This repo contains two versions. My first attempt is titled *fizzBuzz.js* and contains my first attempt (along with the *fizzBuzzSpec.js*). 

My second attempt is titled *fizzBuzzTwo.js* which contains a refactored version (along with the *fizzBuzzTwoSpec.js*) after getting to grips more with the syntax of this strange new world!
